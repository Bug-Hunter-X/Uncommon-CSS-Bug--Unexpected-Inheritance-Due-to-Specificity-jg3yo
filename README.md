# Uncommon CSS Bug: Unexpected Inheritance Due to Specificity

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to specificity and inheritance.  The bug highlights a situation where sibling/ancestor elements unintentionally inherit styles due to the interplay of CSS specificity and inheritance.

## Bug Description
The bug stems from the interaction of CSS selectors with different levels of specificity and the unexpected inheritance that can result.  The default style applied to a element may be overridden by a more specific selector, but this override may inadvertently affect other elements through inheritance if not explicitly accounted for.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected styling of the div element affected by inheritance.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully considering the inheritance chain and using more specific selectors to override unwanted inheritance, or explicitly restyle elements to remove the undesired inheritance.
